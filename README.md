The Fantasy Dictionary is for people that want to spice their life with extra nonsense. People who need
some words generated, for example for a fantasy project, game, character name or such can get some use
out of it. It is very simple to use; just click a button and choose a letter, a list of translations containing the
English languageâ€™s 10% most popular words appears!

It is not perfect, and will crash if you do one wrong move. The following video has some information on how to run it 
and its downsides.
